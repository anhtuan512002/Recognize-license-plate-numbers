# Recognize license plate numbers


This project involves the development of a license plate recognition system, focused on detecting and recognizing license plates from input videos. The system was developed collaboratively by a team of two, leveraging various technologies including Roboflow, YOLOv5, OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow/Keras for character recognition.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to accurately detect and recognize license plates from input video streams. The system underwent several stages, including data extraction, model training, image enhancement, and character recognition.

## Key Features

- Extraction and labeling of images from input videos using Roboflow.
- Training of a YOLOv5 model for license plate detection utilizing labeled images.
- Enhancement of license plate images by adjusting angles with NumPy and OpenCV.
- Application of a trained character recognition model to identify license plate numbers.
- Achieved high recognition rates for tilted or slightly blurred license plates.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Roboflow
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Extraction and Labeling**: Utilize Roboflow for extracting images from input videos and labeling them accordingly.
2. **Model Training**: Train the YOLOv5 model using the labeled images to detect license plates.
3. **Image Enhancement**: Enhance license plate images by adjusting angles using NumPy and OpenCV.
4. **Character Recognition**: Apply the trained character recognition model to identify license plate numbers.
5. **Integration and Testing**: Integrate all components of the system and conduct thorough testing to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
